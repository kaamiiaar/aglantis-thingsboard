# Thingsboard - Aglantis

This repo complements our requirements document. ThingsBoard developers can use it alongside the document and Figma to guide UI development.

## Project Structure

- **`index.html`**: The default inactive state of the Irrigation Control Dashboard.

  - **Script**: `script-default-page.js`
  - **Styles**: `style.css`

- **`active-page.html`**: The active page where users can skip or pause at set, sequence, or whole farm levels.
  - **Script**: `active-page.js`
  - **Styles**: `style-active.css`

**Note**: This setup is only for demonstrating the functionality. The visual components are incomplete and should be refined by referring to the Figma designs, documentation, and details discussed during the meeting.
